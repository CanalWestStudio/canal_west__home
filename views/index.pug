				h2 Work &amp; Case Studies
				p The privacy of our clients is important. If you would like to view specific examples of project, please <br /><a href="mailto:mcrundo@gmail.com">contact us</a>. Below is a summary of some recent recent work:

					h3 Client 1: Undisclosed
					p A consulting start-up in the building commissioning industry. The clients were tech-saavy and had an idea of what they wanted, but still needed guidance to achieve their desired proper execution. 
				div.panel.panel--inner.panel--under
					h4
						em Step 1: Set Up Services
					h5 Domain Registration, Google Suite, Integrating DNS Services
					ul
						li The first steps to initialize the Client's online services was registering their domains. 
						li Next, <em><strong>G Suite</strong></em> was set up, allowing email and storage for standard <strong>Documents</strong> and <strong>Spreadsheets</strong>, as part of the cloud storage solution <strong>Drive</strong> &ndash; a full data management service used and accessed familiarly like any other folder on your computer or device. 
						li Best of all, <em><strong>G Suite</em></strong> products are great for collaboration, along with their <strong>Hangouts</strong> platform for text, screenshare, or video conferences. 
						li All <em><strong>G Suite</em></strong> apps are supported and available in your mobile or tablet device's App Store. 
						li Finally, the Client's domain and <em><strong>G Suite</em></strong> were connected by DNS, conveniently making all apps accessible to employees in browser (<em>ex: mail.company.com</em>, <em>drive.company.com</em>, etc.).

					h4
						em Step 2: Project Management
					h5 Kanbanchi
					p The Client had a definite need for a project management solution. Together, we explored common services like Jira, Trello, and ultimately <strong>Kanbanchi</strong>. The latter was selected based on their preference for a simple UI, but also very powerful capabilities that integrate well with G Suite and other services.
				div.panel.panel--inner.panel--under
					h4
						em Step 3: Branding
					h5 Adobe Illustrator &amp; InDesign
					p After gaining a solid understanding of the Client's vision, work moved forward on putting together a branding kit, including: vector logos, custom typefaces, color palette, and a style guide defining internal and external branding guidelines.

						em Step 4: Website + Custom CMS
					h5 Ruby<em><small>(v5)</small></em> on Rails
					p Time to get a website! <strong><em>Canal West</em></strong> developed a bespoke CMS (</em>Content Management System</e>) which allowed logged-in staff of the Client to access a private section to easily enter and manage their own content, which then displayed on their live site.
				div.panel.panel--inner.panel--under

						em Step 5: Custom "Portal Application"
					h5 MEAN (MongoDB/Express/Angular/Node) + RestfulAPI
					p The Client required a collection of apps to automate and organize their workflow, in addition to simplifying access to project data materials.
					p Due to a quick rush to market, the Client used FileMaker Pro to perform their basic necessary tasks. This was not an issue and allowed an easy transition to the custom app.
					p The "Portal Application" 
					ul 
						li Node API with user authentican for employees and subcontractors
						li Re-creation and improvement of workflow from FileMakerPro to custom applets
						li MongoDB with double backup redundancy
						li Angular forms and custom user form creation
						li Migration of data to/from FileMaker Pro during transition period
						li Set up of Google Business integration with new workflow and application
						li All applications needed to provide a consistent responsive experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
